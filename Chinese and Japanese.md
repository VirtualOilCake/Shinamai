Some differences are:

Chinese people have smaller and more upward angled eyes, while Japanese people have larger and more downward angled eyes12.
Chinese people speak a tonal language, which means the pitch of their voice can change the meaning of a word. Japanese people speak a non-tonal language, and use soft and calm tones to show politeness13.
Chinese people prefer steamed or fried rice, while Japanese people prefer sticky rice. Chinese cuisine is more diverse and spicy, while Japanese cuisine is more simple and fresh13.
Chinese people greet each other with handshakes or nods, while Japanese people greet each other with bows. Chinese people are more direct and expressive, while Japanese people are more indirect and reserved34.
Chinese people are mostly atheists or follow traditional religions such as Buddhism and Taoism. Japanese people follow both Buddhism and Shintoism, and are more religious than Chinese people3.
Some similarities are:

Both Chinese and Japanese people use chopsticks as their main utensils for eating, and share some common dishes such as noodles, dumplings, and sushi13.
Both Chinese and Japanese people value politeness and social harmony, although the Japanese are more formal and hierarchical than the Chinese3.
Both Chinese and Japanese people have a rich and ancient history, and have influenced each otherâ€™s culture, language, and art for centuries34.
