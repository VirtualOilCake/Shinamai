Chapter 1: Xiaohua and the Unpleasurable Body
mmrgh

"It's already noon?"

Xiaohua wakes up from her bed kind of confused.

"Aaah...Ahhhh..."

Xiaohua notice something weird about her sound.

"Mmnn, is it a cold...? Y'know my body does feel duller than usual..." Xiaohua talks to herself.

Xiaohua is Chinese, and as a proud Chinese national, she tries to find some Lianhua Qingwen capsules to help her with the cold.

"That's weird... Where did my Chinese medicine go?"

Xiaohua can't find any Lianhua Qingwen where she usually put them.

"What is that? Xocova...? Hmmm, it feels familiar but I don't know what it is..."

"Wait... don't tell me..."

Xiaohua realizes what is wrong. She opened her closet, and there was no Hanfu, but only Kimono.

"Chikuso!"

Xiaohua is shocked and lets out a Japanese expression "Chikuso". She realized that something has happened to her body, she is now Japanese!

"It can't be... How can this happen to me..."

Xiaohua tried to calm herself down and think of a solution. 

"Oh-ha-yo-! Onee-chan!" the door is opened by someone.

"Wait...I...I still haven't. No, I mean..."

"Hohh... hohh, hohh." Xiaohua is confused and stutters while trying to explain.

"Onee-chan, it's lunch time already! Come quickly, I'm getting hungry!"

Xiaohua finally realized that she is now in Japan. She has no choice but to accept her new identity. 

"Ohayo, I'm coming!" 

Xiaohua takes a deep breath and accept her new identity as a Japanese. She is now ready to start her new life.
