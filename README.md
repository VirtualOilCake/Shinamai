# Chapter 1: Xiaohua and the Unpleasurable Body

*mmrgh*

"It's already noon?"

Xiaohua wakes up from her bed kind of confused.

"Aaah...Ahhhh..."

Xiaohua notice something is weird about her sound. 

"Mmnn, is it a cold...? Y'know my body does feel duller than usual..." Xiaohua talks to herself.

Xiaohua is a Chinese, as a proud Chinese national, she tries to find some Lianhua Qingwen capsule to help her with the cold. 

"That's weird... Where did my Chinese medicine go?"

Xiaohua can't find any Lianhua Qingwen where she usually put them. 

"What is that? Xocova...? Hmmm, it feels familiar but I don't know what it is..."

"Wait... don't tell me..."

Xiaohua realize what is wrong. She opened her closet, and there were no Hanfu, but only Kimono.

"Chikuso!"

Xiaohua is shocked and let out a Japanese expression "Chikuso". She realized that something has happened to her body, she is now a Japanese!
