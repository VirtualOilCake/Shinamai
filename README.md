Chapter 1: Xiaohua and the Unpleasurable Body
mmrgh

"It's already noon?"

Xiaohua wakes up from her bed kind of confused.

"Aaah...Ahhhh..."

Xiaohua notice something is weird about her sound.

"Mmnn, is it a cold...? Y'know my body does feel duller than usual..." Xiaohua talks to herself.

Xiaohua is Chinese, and as a proud Chinese national, she tries to find some Lianhua Qingwen capsules to help her with the cold.

"That's weird... Where did my Chinese medicine go?"

Xiaohua can't find any Lianhua Qingwen where she usually put them.

"What is that? Xocova...? Hmmm, it feels familiar but I don't know what it is..."

"Wait... don't tell me..."

Xiaohua realizes what is wrong. She opened her closet, and there were no Hanfu, but only Kimono.

"Chikuso!"

Xiaohua is shocked and lets out a Japanese expression "Chikuso". She realized that something has happened to her body, she is now Japanese!

"It can't be... How can this happen to me..."

Xiaohua tried to calm herself down and think of a solution. She started to search the internet and found out that there are people who experienced the same thing as her.

"Maybe I should talk to them and see if they have any advice..."

And so Xiaohua started her journey to find a way to change back to her original self.
