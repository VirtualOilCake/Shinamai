Liu Wei was a Chinese exchange student who had just arrived in Tokyo for a year of study. He was excited to experience the Japanese culture and learn the language, but he also felt nervous and out of place. He had a hard time understanding the locals and making friends, and he often felt lonely and homesick.

One day, he stumbled upon a small shop that sold various trinkets and souvenirs. He entered the shop and was greeted by an old man with a long beard and a friendly smile. "Welcome, welcome," the old man said in Japanese. "What are you looking for?"

Liu Wei looked around the shop and saw many items that caught his eye: a samurai sword, a kimono, a bonsai tree, a manga comic book. He felt a sudden curiosity and fascination with these things. He decided to buy something as a souvenir for himself.

He picked up a wooden mask that looked like a fox. It had red fur, pointed ears, and slanted eyes. It looked mysterious and intriguing. He asked the old man how much it cost.

"That mask is very special," the old man said. "It is a kitsune mask, a mask of a fox spirit. It has the power to transform you into whatever you desire."

Liu Wei was skeptical. He didn't believe in such things. He thought the old man was just trying to sell him the mask. He decided to humor him and asked, "What do you mean? How can it transform me?"

The old man smiled and said, "Just put it on and make a wish. You will see for yourself."

Liu Wei thought it was silly, but he decided to try it anyway. He put on the mask and looked at himself in the mirror. He saw his own face covered by the fox mask. He felt nothing.

He decided to make a wish. He wished that he could become Japanese. He wished that he could fit in with the people here, that he could speak their language fluently, that he could understand their culture and customs.

As soon as he made his wish, he felt a strange sensation in his body. He felt his bones shifting, his muscles tightening, his skin changing color. He felt his eyes becoming smaller and more angled, his hair becoming darker and straighter, his nose becoming flatter and wider.

He took off the mask and looked at himself in the mirror again. He gasped. He didn't recognize himself. He looked like a completely different person. He looked like a Japanese.

He turned to the old man and said in perfect Japanese, "What have you done to me?"

The old man laughed and said, "I told you, it is a kitsune mask. It grants your wish."

Liu Wei was shocked and scared. He didn't want this. He wanted to be himself again. He wanted to be Chinese.

He asked the old man, "How can I change back? How can I undo this?"

The old man shook his head and said, "You can't. The mask only works once. You have made your choice."

Liu Wei felt a surge of panic and anger. He felt betrayed by the old man. He felt like he had lost his identity.

He threw the mask on the floor and ran out of the shop.

He ran through the streets of Tokyo, feeling lost and confused.

He didn't know what to do.

He didn't know who he was.
